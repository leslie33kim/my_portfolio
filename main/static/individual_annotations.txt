Upon Bellicum's request and subject to payment of the Firm Zone Shortfall amount by Bellicum, Miltenyi will, if so requested by Bellicum, provide Bellicum with Miltenyi's remaining stock of the relevant forecasted Miltenyi Products equal in value to such Firm Zone Shortfall amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and for Calendar Year 2019 only, the €[...***...] amount recited as an element used to determine the Minimum Purchase in a Calendar Year is hereby reduced to €[...***...]. If Bellicum fails to tender such firm Purchase Order and has not otherwise met the Minimum Purchase requirements within said [...***...]-day period, then Miltenyi, in its sole discretion, effective immediately upon Bellicum's receipt of written notice of Miltenyi's election to do so, shall have no obligation to Bellicum under this Agreement:(1) not to discontinue the supply of any particular Miltenyi Product;(2) to use [...***...] to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum in accordance with Forecasts provided by or on behalf of Bellicum; and(3) to provide Regulatory Work in accordance with Section 4.3. Minimum Purchases referred to above will include the quantities of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in accordance with applicable Forecasts that could not be supplied by Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of Delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped Miltenyi Product shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B as such Exhibit B Module may be amended from time to time by written notification of Miltenyi to Bellicum. As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed<omitted>ordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. Unless otherwise set forth in a relevant Module, the quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) forecasted for each Calendar Month of the Firm Zone of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast submitted pursuant to Section 5.1(a) of this Agreement shall be binding on both Parties, commencing on the Effecctive Date of the Agreement (but not for the first three months thereto), and in each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall have the firm obligation to order at a minimum the amount of Miltenyi Product(s) specified for the first (1st) Calendar Month of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast<omitted>(such amount, the "Firm Zone Requirements"). In addition, the Parties shall from time to time discuss in good faith and mutually and reasonably agree upon (i) whether one or more Miltenyi Products require a minimum inventory to be held by Bellicum, and (ii) whether there shall be any type of Miltenyi Product that require a minimum inventory to be held by Miltenyi on behalf of Bellicum and under which terms and conditions such minimum inventory shall be reserved for Bellicum. At the time Bellicum reaches the Minimum Purchase requirements again, Miltenyi and Bellicum shall in good faith agree to continue the supply commitment. Bellicum will order Miltenyi Product in a defined number of units, subject to reasonable minimum order size requirements that may vary according to product type.
